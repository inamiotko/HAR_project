# HAR_project
Human Activity Recognition using various neural networks and Human Activity Data representation using python.
Project based on WISDM dataset containing measurements from accelerometer, including activities such as walking, jogging, standing, sitting, walking upstairs and walking downstairs. 
The projects contains 2 different nn models. Where one is  straightforward CNN model and other is simple multilayer perceptron. 
The obtained accuracies are 86% for multilayer perceptron and 89% for CNN model.
